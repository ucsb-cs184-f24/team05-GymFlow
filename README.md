# team05-GymFlow

Our project looks to monitor activity at the UCSB Recreation Center so that students can gauge how busy the gym is.

In gymflow, the interface will provide users with a graphic of how busy the UCSB Recreation Center is. Users will have to sign up using their phone number and authentication will be provided as well. The app will be built using Swift and will only be available on IOS platforms. We plan for this app to help gym-goers plan their workouts more efficiently. There is one user role in this app which is users who want to know how busy the gym is.
