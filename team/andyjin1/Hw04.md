## HW4 Part A: Planning Phase

- After the executing of the current design, there would be another button on the bottom bar of the app named "Forecast" where it would take the user to a page where they can visually see a forecast of the gym business. This feature allows users to not only get info on current gym business level but also see when is the best time to go based on their schedule.

## HW4 Part B: Implementation Phase
- # Documentation of Main Results


- **Description**: The image showcases the completed forecast feature as part of the application. It includes a "Predict" button that fetches real-time data from the `BestTime.app` API. The page dynamically displays the venue name, opening and closing times, and day-specific information. Additionally, an interactive histogram visualizes hourly intensity levels, allowing users to interpret venue activity trends easily. The implementation enhances the app by providing a user-friendly and visually appealing tool for planning visits based on real-time data. The images below show a before and after.

# Forecast Feature Implementation

The forecast feature was implemented to provide users with real-time insights into venue busyness levels, empowering them to make informed decisions about the best times to visit. This feature includes a "Predict" button that fetches data from the `BestTime.app` API and displays the venue's name, operating hours, and hourly activity trends in a user-friendly format. The implementation introduced a dynamic, interactive UI with a histogram to visualize hourly intensity data, enhancing the application's functionality and user experience.

## Tech Stacks
- **Programming Language**: Swift
- **UI Frameworks**: SwiftUI for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces; UIKit for integrating SwiftUI views using `UIHostingController`.
- **Networking**: `URLSession` for API integration, handling HTTP requests, and fetching real-time forecast data.
- **Data Parsing**: Swift's `Codable` protocol for decoding JSON responses into structured models (`DayForecastResponse`, `HourAnalysis`).
- **Reactive Programming**: SwiftUI's `@Published` properties for automatically updating the UI when new data is fetched.
- **Visualization**: Custom SwiftUI components like `HistogramView` to display hourly intensity data interactively.
- **Design Enhancements**: Gradients, buttons, and layout elements in SwiftUI for an engaging user interface.

This implementation bridges backend data retrieval with an intuitive frontend, transforming the app into a more powerful and user-centric tool.
