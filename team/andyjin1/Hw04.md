## HW4: Implementation

- After the executing of the current design, there would be another button on the bottom bar of the app named "Forecast" where it would take the user to a page where they can visually see a forecast of the gym business. This feature allows users to not only get info on current gym business level but also see when is the best time to go based on their schedule.
