## Action item

* a goal: Have more concrete ideas that we want to implement in our app
* a change: Use the Kanban more actively so that it is up to date with out current tasks
* a measurement: We see that the issues are being completed or are in the code review section

## Retro Assessment

* A brief description of what retro outline or process you used: We all talked in person about a goal, change, and measurement to agree on.
* A brief assessment of how it went: It went smoothly, the retro went well.
* What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro
  based on what you learned today: Initiate the meeting and ask the questions.


## Outcomes

* With the retro goal, we were able to agree on how the home screen looks with the gym busy level. The Kanban board is not as actively used, but is better now.
