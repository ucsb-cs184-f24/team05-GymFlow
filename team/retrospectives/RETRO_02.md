# Date of Retrospective: 11/13/24

* Led by: Bryce
* Present: Tommy, Bryce, Nevin, Andy, Winston
* Absent: 

## Action item

* a goal: we want to get better at using the KanBan board
* a change: everyone should create and update their own tasks so that we can keep track of the progress
* a measurement: we want to see more tasks being made and moved to the done column

## Retro Assessment

* We talked in person about what goal and how we want to change to achieve it.
* The retro went well and we were able to collectively decide on what we want to improve.
* I would suggest having everyone come up with something we can work on and choose the one we think is best for our team.

## Outcomes

* We see more tasks being made, but we can be moving them to the proper stage more consistently.
