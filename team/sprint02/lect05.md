# Lecture 10/14
Everyone is present except Nandhan  
Sprint Planning/Standup: Created a Kanban board in github to keep track of our tasks. We are adding and assigning issues that we should start working on. Everyone knows what to do and is starting on their issue. Since Nandhan did not show up to lecture and not responding, we are deciding to remove him from the group.
