# User Feedback Needs

1. **Forecast Feature**  
   - Do you think the forecast feature is useful? Specifically, should the forecast graph be a line graph or a bar chart? Explain why. We want to make it as easy as possible for users to see which days are most occupied in a visually appealing way.

2. **Crowd Meter Accuracy**  
   - This might be an extensive ask but we would like you to test the app and evaluate whether the crowd meter is relatively accurate. Would it be better to quantify the crowd level as percentages (60% full) instead of using descriptive words like "average" or "very crowded"?

3. **Notification Preferences**  
   - Would users want notifications when the gym is less crowded (below average)? This feature could help users go to the gym when itâ€™s relatively empty for a more efficient workout. However, it might also mean receiving notifications at inconvenient times, like early morning (6 am) or late evening (8 pm). Would this be fine or be an annoying feature?
  
Thank you for all the feedback.
