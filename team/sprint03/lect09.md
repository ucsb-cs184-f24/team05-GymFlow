# Lecutre 10/28
Everyone is present  
Standup: We are getting the starter code up by getting the authentication working. Everyone is working on what to contribute for HW3. 
Spring Planning: After we get the code up our goal is to have everyone run it on their own computer and add build instructions to the Readme.
