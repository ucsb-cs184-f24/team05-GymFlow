My primary role was working on the forecast feature. The user can see a histogram indicating the raw hour percentages. The information are sourced from besttime.app and 100% means that the given venue is curretly at the max busy level. The bars will dynamically change based on the day of week. 

## Bryce
I made implemented UI changes to all the pages so that there is a consistent design. I helped changed the histogram and busy level reading by changing their style and using a different API call so that their readings were more accurate. I also created the Manual for our app.

## Daniel
I contributed primarily to the development of the BusyLevelView and HistogramView components. My work focused on creating a visually appealing and functional speedometer that dynamically adjusts based on real-time gym data, ensuring smooth animations and accurate needle positioning. I also improved the UI for the HistogramView by formatting the time labels for better readability. Additionally, I implemented authentication using FirebaseAuth to enable easy phone number login and refined the UI for both authentication pages. Lastly, I fixed the data retrieval process by converting the API output from descriptive "words" to actionable numerical data, enhancing the app's functionality and accuracy.

## Nevin
I worked on the initial prototypes of the UI. In addition to this, I also created the feature that allowed you to get meal advice for the food provided in the dining halls.

## Thomas
Worked on connecting sign on page with app main screen. Helped with back-end research for API. Created app layout design and helped introduce our current features. Created Gemini feature for workout prompts.

## Winston
I worked on the initial logo design as well as built the feature that allows the user to take a picture of their ID and store it on the app to use to scan in at the Recreation Center. I also did extensive testing and debugging.
