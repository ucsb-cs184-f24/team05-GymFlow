## Andy
My primary role was working on the forecast feature. The user can see a histogram indicating the raw hour percentages. The information are sourced from besttime.app and 100% means that the given venue is curretly at the max busy level. The bars will dynamically change based on the day of week. 

## Bryce (Scribe)
I made implemented UI changes to all the pages so that there is a consistent design. I helped changed the histogram and busy level reading by changing their style and using a different API call so that their readings were more accurate. I also created the Manual for our app.

## Daniel (Product Owner)
I contributed primarily to the development of the BusyLevelView and HistogramView components. My work focused on creating a visually appealing and functional speedometer that dynamically adjusts based on real-time gym data, ensuring smooth animations and accurate needle positioning. I also improved the UI for the HistogramView by formatting the time labels for better readability. Additionally, I implemented authentication using FirebaseAuth to enable easy phone number login and refined the UI for both authentication pages. Lastly, I fixed the data retrieval process by converting the API output from descriptive "words" to actionable numerical data, enhancing the app's functionality and accuracy.

## Nevin
My initial work involved with creating the first prototypes for the UI of this app. Later, I became focused on building a feature that allowed users to get nutritional advice about the food they eat at dining halls. Finally. I worked on the user interface of the AI workout plan. I added pictures to the buttons and gave the screen a cleaner look.

Created Gemini feature for workout prompts. Emphasis on general debugging and devOps work with most PRs. Was main tester for simulator + physical devices. Scrum master + large portion of Kanban board use.

## Winston
I worked on the initial logo design as well as built the feature that allows the user to take a picture of their ID and store it on the app to use to scan in at the Recreation Center. I also did extensive testing and debugging.
