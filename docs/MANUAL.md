## Purpose
Our app is designed to assist UCSB students in effectively planning their gym sessions. By providing real-time information about the current busyness of the gym and forecasting future crowd levels, the app enables users to choose optimal times for their workouts, enhancing their gym going experience.

## Authentication
When launching the app for the first time, users are prompted to enter their phone number. A verification code is then sent to the provided number for authentication. Once verified, the user is securely logged into the app.

## Home Page
The Home Page provides a view of the UCSB gym's busyness level. A speedometer-style gauge displays the current gym capacity as a percentage, giving users a quick understanding of how crowded the gym is. Below the gauge, a graph visualizes the predicted busyness levels for each hour of the day, helping users plan their visits more effectively.

## Workouts Page
The Workout Guide Page offers workout plans to help users achieve their fitness goals. Four buttons—Push, Pull, Legs, and Cardio—allow users to quickly access curated workout routines for each focus area. Once a workout is selected, it is saved and remains the same if revisited during the same app session. However, when the app is exited and reopened, new workout plans are generated, ensuring variety and fresh routines for each session.

## ID Page
The ID Page allows users to conveniently take a picture of their UCSB ID. This digital version can be used to scan into the gym if the physical ID is forgotten, ensuring seamless access and eliminating the need to carry a physical card.
