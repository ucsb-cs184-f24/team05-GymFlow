# Manual

## Purpose
Our app is designed to assist UCSB students in effectively planning their gym sessions. By providing real-time information about the current busyness of the gym and forecasting future crowd levels, the app enables users to choose optimal times for their workouts, enhancing their gym going experience.

## Authentication
When first opening the app, users will first be prompted to enter a phone number and sent a verification code. This will be used to authenticate the user and log them in.
