Our app homescreen contains a forecast and live busy level of the UCSB Recreational Center. Pressing the refresh updates the live busy level.
The settings screen contains general settings and the option to log out. The barcode screen is for a user to take a picture of their 
access card and store it on the app. This allows the user to show the app to scan into the rec center.

We agreed to display a forecast of the gym busy level. We also agreed to have an access card implementation to save the barcode on the app.

We considered keeping the app simple with tabs and screens. We allowed each screen to be accessible.
